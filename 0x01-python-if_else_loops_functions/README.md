### [0 - Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.py)
* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. In order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

### [1 - The last digit](./1-last_digit.py)
* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. In order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

### [2 - I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](./2-print_alphabet.py)
* A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### [3 - When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](./3-print_alphabt.py)
* A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### [4 - Hexadecimal printing](./4-print_hexa.py)
* A program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example).
```bash
0 = 0x0
1 = 0x1
2 = 0x2
3 = 0x3
4 = 0x4
5 = 0x5
6 = 0x6
7 = 0x7
8 = 0x8
9 = 0x9
10 = 0xa
11 = 0xb
12 = 0xc
13 = 0xd
14 = 0xe
15 = 0xf
16 = 0x10
17 = 0x11
18 = 0x12
...
96 = 0x60
97 = 0x61
98 = 0x62
```

### [5 - 00...99](./5-print_comb2.py)
* A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99

### [6 - Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](./6-print_comb3.py)
* A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### [7 - Islower](./7-islower.py)
* A function that checks for lowercase character.

### [8 - To uppercase](./8-uppercase.py)
* A function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### [9 - There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](./9-print_last_digit.py)
* A function that prints the last digit of a number.

### [10 - a + b](./10-add.py)
* A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### [11 - a ^ b](./11-pow.py)
* A function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

### [12 - Fizz Buzz](./12-fizzbuzz.py)
* A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. 
* For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### [13 - Insert in sorted linked list](./13-insert_number.c)
* A function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### [Header File](./lists.h)
* Header file containing all prototypes used in this project
