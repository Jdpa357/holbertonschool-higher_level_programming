### [2. Replace element](./2-replace_in_list.py)
* A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

### [3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!](./3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)
* A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

### [4. Replace in a copy](./4-new_in_list.py)
* A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

### [5. Can you C me now?](./5-no_c.py)
* A function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

### [6. Lists of lists = Matrix](./6-print_matrix_integer.py)
